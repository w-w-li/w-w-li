## Hi! My name is William Li, and I am a Computer Science graduate of the University of Chicago.

I am interested using data analysis and machine learning to make business decisions.
- I am currently working on a project to predict what college basketball players will become good three-point shooters in the NBA.
- You can find some of the projects I completed at school under the "UChicago" repository.
